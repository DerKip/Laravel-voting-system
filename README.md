Below is an installation guide:

1.	Make sure you have Xampp or Wamp installed in your machine, Laravel 5, Git and composer need also be already installed.

2.	Start the Git bash on the root folder and type : “ php artisan serve”, of which will start a Laravel development server on the local host at port 8000 
  
3.	Afterwards, start apache

5.	Create new database titled e-voting
